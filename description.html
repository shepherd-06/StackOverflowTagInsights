    <h1>Collapsible Tree of Tags and Questions</h1>

    <p>This visualization represents a hierarchical breakdown of programming collectives, tags, and questions.</p>
    <p>Each collective (e.g., 'Mobile Development') is represented as a top-level block. Clicking on a collective
        expands it to show associated tags (e.g., 'android', 'ios'). Clicking on a tag reveals additional question
        statistics, including total questions, top and least voted question scores, and median statistics for votes and
        answer counts.</p>
